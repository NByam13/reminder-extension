# Reminder Extension

A toy chrome extension that I'm building using [this tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/) as a guide, to understand the fundamentals and capabilities of the chrome browser's many helpful APIs.

It's still a WIP and largely just some code to play around with for my own exploration.
